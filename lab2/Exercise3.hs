{-
We defined the symClos function, which takes a list of pairs. It then recursively
iterates through this list. Each step it:
- Takes the head and appends it to the new list
- Takes the head and appends its inverted variant to the new list
- Calls itself on the tail

The definition of the symmetric closure is:
"The symmetric closure of a relation R on a set A is the smallest relation Râ€² that contains R and is symmetric."
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/engineering-mathematics/closure-relations/).
Our implementation fits this definition.
