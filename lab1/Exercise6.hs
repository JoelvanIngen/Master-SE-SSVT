 Exercise 6
 Week 3’s lectures discusses the conversion of Boolean formulas (formulas of propositional logic) 
into CNF form. The lecture notes also give a definition of a Haskell datatype for formulas of 
propositional logic, using lists for conjunctions and disjunctions. Your task is to write a Haskell 
program for converting formulas into CNF.
 Use the following declaration: 
cnf :: Form -> Form
 Deliverables: conversion program with documentation, indication of time spent.

type Name = Int
data Form = Prop Name
    | Neg Form
    | Cnj [Form]
    | Dsj [Form]
    | Impl Form Form
    | Equiv Form Form
    deriving (Eq,Ord,Show)

To convert any formula into CNF form the following order of steps is needed:
Remove implication and equivalence (remove arrows):
- P --> Q -> ¬P ∨ Q
- P <--> Q -> (P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬Q)
Then, convert to negation normal form (logically equivalent, but split props into negations):
- P -> ¬(¬P)
- ¬(P ∨ Q) -> ¬P ∧ ¬Q and reverse for ∨/∧
Then, use distributive law:
- (P ∨ (Q ∧ R)) -> (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R) (but not reverse for ∨/∧, since this is CNF not DNF)
This makes a logically equivalent formula that exists only of conjuctions of disjunctions of atoms:
(P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R) ∧ ...

-- Replaces implications and equivalences with logical equivalences
arrowfree :: Form -> Form
arrowfree (Prop x) = Prop x
arrowfree (Neg f) = Neg (arrowfree f)
arrowfree (Cnj fs) = Cnj (map arrowfree fs)
arrowfree (Dsj fs) = Dsj (map arrowfree fs)
arrowfree (Impl f1 f2) = Dsj [Neg (arrowfree f1), arrowfree f2]
arrowfree (Equiv f1 f2) = Dsj [Cnj [f1', f2'], Cnj [Neg f1', Neg f2']]
    where
        f1' = arrowfree f1
        f2' = arrowfree f2

-- Converts to negation normal form
nnf :: Form -> Form
nnf (Prop x) = Prop x
nnf (Neg (Prop x)) = Neg (Prop x)
nnf (Neg (Neg f)) = nnf f
nnf (Cnj fs) = Cnj (map nnf fs)
nnf (Dsj fs) = Dsj (map nnf fs)
nnf (Neg (Cnj fs)) = Dsj (map (nnf . Neg) fs)
nnf (Neg (Dsj fs)) = Cnj (map (nnf . Neg) fs)

-- Convert using distributive law ( (P ∨ (Q ∧ R)) -> (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R) )
dlaw :: Form -> Form
dlaw (Prop x) = Prop x
dlaw (Neg f) = Neg (dlaw f)
dlaw (Cnj fs) = Cnj (map dlaw fs)

dlaw (Dsj [f1, Cnj fs]) = 
    let distributed = map (\g -> Dsj [dlaw f1, dlaw g]) fs
    in Cnj distributed

dlaw (Dsj [Cnj fs, f2]) = 
    let distributed = map (\g -> Dsj [dlaw g, dlaw f2]) fs
    in Cnj distributed

dlaw (Dsj fs) = Dsj (map dlaw fs)    
dlaw f = f

p = Prop 1
q = Prop 2
r = Prop 3

cnf :: Form -> Form
cnf = dlaw . nnf . arrowfree

test1 = cnf (Impl p q)
test2 = cnf (Equiv p q)
test3 = cnf (Dsj [p, Cnj [q, r]])

{-Test Report:
  This program correctly converts a Boolean formula to CNF using the following three steps:
  arrowfree: Eliminates implication and equivalence relations
  nnf: Converts the formula to negation normal form
  dlaw: Applies the distributive law to generate CNF

  Test 1: p -> q -> Expected ¬p ∨ q
  Test 2: p <-> q -> Expected (p ∧ q) ∨ (¬p ∧ ¬q)
  Test 3: p ∨ (q ∧ r) -> Expected (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)
  The program output matches these expected results, so each basic step is followed.
  More complicated tests should be done to test formulas that don't follow this specific format.
