Next, analyze what's wrong with impls 1-8.

1. Its correct
2.False. When executing the open command in the closed state, the error output "closed" is returned instead of "opened"
3.False. After unlocking, it stays in the locked state (2) instead of entering the closed state (1)
4.False. The lock and unlock commands are interchanged
5.False. The open command returns "open" instead of "opened"
6.False. The door got stuck after three open/close cycles.
7.False. Improper handling of incorrect key codes in certain states. 
   Does not return to 1 after unlocking, entering the wrong state space.
8.False. The semantics of states 3, 5, and 7 were unclear, and many states lacked handling for certain commands.
